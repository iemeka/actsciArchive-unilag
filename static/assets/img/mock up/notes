building for phones first not pc
same design but redesign heading with unilag and actsci logo.
divide page into two - 
		- first half: 
			divide into two:
				- 40% for header(logo and all) - 
				- remaining 60% + second half title,seearch box and recents uploads 
body - make text smaller
past questions must include an hyphen or colon then the year
search result and recent upload page should have same structure
so basically same design except header with some modifications to the body 

new idea - let new home page be search page with link to recent upload page. delete 'select year for past questions'.
remake all page be consitent with colors,font-size and font-family

course upload is for me.
basically we have just 3 page. home(with search input element), recent uploads (with search input element), search result (with search input element)

for more ideas hope on completion of html5 and css3 pdf book
